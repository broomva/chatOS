# Platforms

The bot uses the [Chat SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chat) adapter pattern, making it straightforward to support multiple platforms.

## Slack

**Status**: Supported

The Slack adapter handles:
- Webhook signature verification
- Event parsing (mentions, messages, reactions)
- Thread management and subscriptions
- Streaming message delivery
- URL verification challenges

See [Configuration](/docs/bot/configuration) for setup instructions.

## Future Platforms

The Chat SDK supports additional platforms that can be added:

### Discord

```typescript
import { createDiscordAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/discord";

const bot = new Chat({
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
    discord: createDiscordAdapter(),
  },
});
```

### Microsoft Teams

```typescript
import { createTeamsAdapter } from "@chat-adapter/teams";

const bot = new Chat({
  adapters: {
    slack: createSlackAdapter(),
    teams: createTeamsAdapter(),
  },
});
```

## Adding a New Platform

To add a platform:

1. Install the Chat SDK adapter package for the platform
2. Add the adapter to the `Chat` constructor in `src/bot.ts`
3. Create a new route in `src/routes/` for the platform's webhook
4. Configure the platform to send events to the new webhook URL

Each platform adapter handles its own authentication, event format parsing, and message delivery. The core bot logic (AI response generation) is shared across all platforms.
