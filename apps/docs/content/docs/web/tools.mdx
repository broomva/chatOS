# Tools

The chat endpoint provides tools that the AI model can invoke during a conversation. Tools are defined with Zod schemas in `packages/ai/src/tools/index.ts`.

## getWeather

Get the current weather at a geographic location.

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `latitude` | `number` | Latitude of the location |
| `longitude` | `number` | Longitude of the location |

**Returns:**

```json
{
  "temperature": 22.5,
  "unit": "celsius"
}
```

Uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) — no API key required.

## createDocument

Create a new document artifact that appears in the side panel.

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | Title of the document |
| `kind` | `"text" \| "code" \| "image" \| "sheet"` | Type of document to create |

This is a client-side tool — the AI SDK handles the UI rendering.

## updateDocument

Update an existing document artifact.

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | ID of the document to update |
| `description` | `string` | Description of changes to make |

## requestSuggestions

Request improvement suggestions for a document.

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `documentId` | `string` | ID of the document to get suggestions for |

## Tool Invocation Flow

1. The AI model decides to call a tool based on the conversation context
2. A `tool-call` stream part is sent with the tool name and arguments
3. For server-side tools (like `getWeather`), execution happens automatically
4. A `tool-result` stream part is sent back with the result
5. The model uses the result to continue generating its response

In the UI, tool invocations appear as structured `MessagePart` objects with type `"tool-invocation"`.
