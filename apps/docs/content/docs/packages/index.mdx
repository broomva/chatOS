# Packages

chatOS uses six internal packages shared between applications. All packages live in the `packages/` directory and are referenced as workspace dependencies.

## Package Map

| Package | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [@chatos/ai](/docs/packages/ai) | `packages/ai` | AI models, tools, prompts, streaming |
| [@chatos/db](/docs/packages/db) | `packages/db` | Drizzle ORM schema and queries |
| [@chatos/auth](/docs/packages/auth) | `packages/auth` | Better Auth configuration |
| [@chatos/types](/docs/packages/types) | `packages/types` | Shared TypeScript types |
| [@chatos/ui](/docs/packages/ui) | `packages/ui` | shadcn/ui components |
| @chatos/config | `packages/config` | tsconfig, Biome, Tailwind presets |

## Dependency Graph

```
@chatos/config, @chatos/types   (leaf — no deps)
  → @chatos/db     (config, types)
  → @chatos/auth   (config, types, db)
  → @chatos/ai     (config, types)
  → @chatos/ui     (config, types)
```

## Usage

All packages are referenced using workspace protocol:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@chatos/ai": "workspace:*",
    "@chatos/types": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Import from the package name directly:

```typescript
import { chatModels, DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL } from "@chatos/ai/models";
import { weatherTool } from "@chatos/ai";
import type { Message, ChatModel } from "@chatos/types";
```
